    description: "I was so close to finding a cure. A way to unlock a man's complex mental notions such that his very conscienceness us transferred to a machine. It wasn't an easy journey. Hell, I would know. I lost everything and everyone in the process. The dark matter injections sure did not help with the quest to host my intellect. I succumbed to repeated failures.",

    description: "Everytime I found a way to push through the contellations of neural matter in my brain to a box. I called COGNOLOCK, I discovered a shocking side effect. I has negun to lose parts of me. My Memory, my intellect, everything swallowed whole by th disciplined process of experminentation I subjected myself to. But nothing could deter me. I would not stop.",

But the rabo needs to process this bleeding edge technology which can better so many lives has dug it's sadistic roots deep into my soul. Some days I wake up not remembering who I am. Other days I'm an inch away from building a functional interface to convert my brain to COGNOLOCK",

    description: "Finally I made the groundbreaking discovery of the missing pieces. The dark matter injection procedure I used on myself is the key to bridge the gap between a breathing consiouness and a computer. I just need to up the coltage by a large threshold, flood the chamber with dark matter and the transference would effectively lock a miniversion of me in the box. I'm so close. I know the risks but I must try.",

    description: "Today is the day I change the world. I ran the safety parameters. Everything  seems to fall right into place. There is a high chance of the dark matter overloading the cap, resulting in a mass explosion. Overall result: The aftermath of such a discharge could affect the minds of the wide population, just as mine will be affected. I might lose myself into the machine but I have to try. Just like my mother always says 'Believe in yourself'. If this doesn't work, I have a fail-safe hiddent in my Journal. Only the smartest of the minds can crack it and is the worlds last hope.",
